This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop within the useEffect hook. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from updating state within the effect's callback without proper dependency management, creating an infinite loop that can crash the application. The solution demonstrates how to correctly manage dependencies to prevent this problem.
